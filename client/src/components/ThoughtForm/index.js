// PRO TIP: Because the ThoughtForm and ReactionForm components are so similar, you could combine them into a more generic Form component to make your code more DRY. Doing so would involve passing in a few more props, though. For example, one prop could be a callback function that runs the necessary mutation. That way, the Form component itself wouldn't need to import useMutation. It would be part of the parent component and used in the callback.
