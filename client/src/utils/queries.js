// With this query, we're requesting significantly less data to be returned over HTTP. If we were to do this with a RESTful API, we'd have to create another route to query a user and return less information. With GraphQL, we can reuse the same query we created and simply ask for less.

// With GraphQL, there's even a way to use the same exact front-end query to request less information, but it's advanced technique. Once you feel more comfortable with GraphQL and Apollo, look up how to use something called "Directives"!
